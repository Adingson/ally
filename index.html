          <h1>Reason</h1>
          <p>
            It was 2020 and the covid-19 pandemic had just started, I just
            graduated from high school and everyday I wake up with nothing to do
            than to just stare at my computer for the whole day. I was very
            skinny often staying up very late playing games all night and not
            waking up for lunch. as days goes by my patience was slowly getting
            worse and so was my confidence. My arms and legs were as thin as a
            stick and my health was worsening. I hated the way my body looked,
            scrawny looking along with having pimples, I didn't want to be
            insecure anymore, I wanted to be able to look at myself in the
            mirror and not be ashamed. Though my first 1-5 months were hard, I
            tried my best to be consistent, the gym journey was expensive and I
            didnt have much money on me. And the hardest part of it was the
            nutrition, I forced myself to eat as much as i can in order to grow.
            And now looking back, I can confidently say that I didn't have any
            regrets, I enjoyed every bit of it and hopefully will stay
            consistent.
